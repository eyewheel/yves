a library for the books you want to read

### goals

* feel nice, look good
* will never recommend you any "bestselling" slop
* not dependent on interacting with a network of other users and trying to validate their tastes
* will, however, recommend you things that are not directly keyword related to what you're looking for
* fun, satisfying "browsing experience" with as close to the vibes of physically wandering the stacks as possible

### design (in progress)

* depends on human-curated lists - there's no way to externally validate the quality of a book on any metric other than "a certain set of humans liked it" without access to all its contents
* only contains the human-curated lists you throw in - if you're like me, at least, you already have lots of these lists

### why the name?

in the early 2000s ttrpg *In Nomine* (think *Good Omens* as a World of Darkness splatbook), yves is the archangel of destiny who maintains a slightly surreal, ominous library containing all knowledge in existence

notable features of the library of yves include:
* you will always find what you're looking for, or else something you didn't even know what you were looking for
* but you will have to wander around for a while first, so if you don't actually want to read, you won't have a good time
* reshapes itself to every visitor, but has reliably extant areas that you can agree to meet people in
* represents the subconscious mind of god, maybe
